The component has gone into series production with the new Audi A4 2.0 FSI 4V. The lower and inner parts of the newly developed manifold are made of Ultramid® B3WG6. The upper shell\r\nfeaturing the metallic-effect is visible in the motor compartment and is made of Ultramid® B3EG6 Titanium Grey. Both these grades are highly heatstabilised polyamide-6 types with 30 percent glass fibre. Unlike the conventional gasoline engines, with the FSI®\r\nengines the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber (FSI: Fuel Stratified Injection).\r\nThis increases the torque and the power, the engine has lower fuel consumption, and the exhaust gas emission data are significantly improved.\r\n","Benefits":"Regarding exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) direct injection gasoline engines make for increased demands on the manifold system. The part is exposed to high temperatures and corrosive agents from the exhaust gas. Thanks to the specific formulation Ultramid® can fully withstand these loadings. Its dimensional, thermal and chemical stability make Ultramid® the material of choice for this intake manifold system. The two types of Ultramid® are perfectly matched. Both grades can be easily processed by injection moulding and vibration welding. This leads to high process reliability, and ensures that the component achieves the required resistance to bursting pressure.\r\nUltramid® Titanium Grey gives an attractive, granular metallic appearance. The material also displays high colour stability under the corrosive conditions in the engine compartment. This means that the component fulfils the Audi designers’ special requirements on engine styling without additional painting. A further advantage over painted components is that the surface of the manifold is not susceptible to scratches or small flashes.","External Link":null,"Case_Study_Type":"Typical","image1_meta":"intake system B3WG6 B3EG6.JPG;1;E960FEDD-E62E-45C0-B0F3-7E301B6A8A9B","image2_meta":null,"image3_meta":null,"image4_meta":null,"Last_Modified":"2021-01-20T09:31:00+01:00","bc_code":"UP"},{"@row.id":2220,"case_study_id":"3061","Application":"Mounting Brackets in Aluminium roof","Confidential":false,"process_id":"14","country_id":null,"Function and Key Requirements":"The first Ferrari theme park in the world is located in Abu Dhabi, on the island of Yas.
